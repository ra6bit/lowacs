# nmap-screenshot-cutycapt
A quick script based on nmap-screenshot but utilizing cutycapt instead of wkhtmltopdf. I actually forget if I made this or Baker Hamilton did, or what we were up to.  I mean, there's like 6 lines here that are changed.. I just keept this here because it's handy!

This script is currently based heavily on the http-screenshot.nse script by Ryan Limm
